    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a favorite at our house, and I make these at least once a week. Onions are optional, but a sweet white onion chopped and fried with the potatoes gives the potatoes 
        a special flavor. My favorite meal is pinto beans, fried potatoes, and cornbread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium Russet potatoes ; peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 small Onion ; chopped</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil ; as required*</li>
        <li>salt and pepper ; to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel, wash, and dice the potatoes in bite sized pieces. Put enough oil in the bottom of a medium sized non-stick skillet to cover the bottom of the pan, and be about 
            1/4 inch deep. Heat oil over medium high heat until hot. You can check the temperature by dropping a piece of potato into the oil. If the piece of potato sizzles, 
            you are ready to add the rest of the potatoes and onions.</li>
        <li>After you add the vegetables to the hot oil, generously salt and pepper them, cover with a splatter screen, if desired, and let them fry for about 10 minutes. Gently turn 
            the potatoes over, and let them fry for about another 10 minutes. Be careful not to turn the potatoes too often, or they will begin to disolve. Continue frying and turning 
            until the potatoes reach desired doneness. I like to have a plate lined with a paper towel ready to take them up on. This allows the excess oil to drain off of the 
            vegetables. Add salt and pepper to taste after removing from the skillet, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
